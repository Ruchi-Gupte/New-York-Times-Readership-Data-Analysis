This repository contains the NYT dataset along with user and author analysis conducted as part of the final project in CIS 545: Big Data Analytics. 
We use a dataset containing articles and comments obtained from the well known newspaper 'The New York Times' to extract patterns in reader behaviour and NYT article trends across multiple domains and subsequently determine public opinion and impact from the analysis of their behaviour and reception of various articles.

The provided notebook will walk you through the entire process by downloading and acquiring datasets, conducting an exploratory data analysis, data wrangling, feature engineering and modelling.
